## Toturial
A Jupyter notebook toturial is available at

[tutorial/tutorial.ipynb](tutorial/tutorial.ipynb).


## Installation
The package can be installed using pip from github:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/GillesVanDeVyver/EchoGAINS.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the source code and install it using pip:
```bash
pip install .
```

## Main features
EchoGAINS creates many variations of a labelled image without affecting annotation quality
An image and it's label are transformed and the missing parts are inpainted to create a
realistic sector again.

A segmentation model trained on the augmented dataset is significantly more robust.
